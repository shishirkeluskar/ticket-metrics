= Ticket Metrics
:toc:
:sectnums:

== Project Overview

TicketMetrics is a Spring Boot gRPC service that calculates weighted scores for support tickets based on category ratings. It provides aggregated daily or weekly scores, per-ticket summaries, overall quality metrics, and period-over-period comparisons using SQLite and MyBatis for data access.

== Technology Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.4
* Gradle 8.14
* MyBatis 3.0
* SQLLite
* gRPC

== Features Implemented

* Weighted ticket score algorithm (0–100%) using category weights and 0–5 ratings
* Aggregated category scores over time (daily ≤ 1 month, weekly > 1 month)
* Per-ticket category score aggregation within a date range
* Overall quality score for a selected period
* Period-over-period score comparison

=== Scoring Strategy


At the core is the `ScoreCalculator`, a shared component that normalizes raw ratings into percentage-based scores using predefined rules.

All gRPC operations delegate to this calculator to ensure consistent score computation across different endpoints and aggregation levels.

=== Caching Mechanism

To optimize performance, the api uses multiple *on-demand caches*, where values are computed and stored upon first request (cache miss):

- *Per-ticket score cache*
Caches the normalized score of individual tickets.

- *Category score per day cache*
Caches aggregate scores of each category per day, supporting daily and weekly aggregation.

- *Overall score per day cache*
Caches overall quality scores across all tickets for a given day.

These caches are *lazy-loaded* — scores are computed only on cache miss, stored for reuse, and then used in subsequent aggregations.

=== Future Enhancements

To further optimize scoring and support long-term data analysis:

- *Introduce a `normalized_rating` table*
Stores precomputed normalized scores, reducing the need for on-the-fly calculation.

- *Move score aggregation to the database*
With normalized ratings persisted, average scores can be queried directly via SQL.

- *Back caches with database tables*
Replace in-memory caches with persisted views or tables, enabling durability and batch preloading.

These enhancements will enable better scalability, database-driven reporting, and reduced memory usage.

== Spring Profiles

* `local` – For local development.
* `prod` – Activated when running via *Docker Compose*. Mimics production-like environment.
* `test` – Applied during unit tests.
* `integration-test` – Used during integration tests. Enables full app wiring.

== Bonus

=== How I Would Build and Deploy the Solution?

There are multiple ways to build and containerize the Spring Boot application:

. *Manual Dockerfile (traditional method)*
* Create a Dockerfile manually with steps to build and run the JAR inside a container.
* Offers flexibility and full control over layers and dependencies.
. *Using Jib (by Google)*
* A Maven/Gradle plugin that builds optimized Docker images without requiring a Dockerfile.
. *Using Spring Boot Buildpacks*
* Spring Boot provides support for Cloud Native Buildpacks (via spring-boot:build-image) which create OCI-compliant images automatically.

=== Deploying the Docker Image

Once the Docker image is built, it can be deployed using various methods:

* *Kubernetes (K8s)*
** A widely adopted orchestration platform for containerized workloads.
** Enables scalability, health checks, service discovery, and auto-restarts.
* *CI/CD Pipelines*
** Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be used to automate testing, building, and deploying the app.
* *GitOps (Modern Practice)*
** GitOps tools like ArgoCD or Flux allow for declarative deployment based on Git commits.

=== Other Considerations
* *Environment Configuration*
** Use Spring Profiles or environment variables for dev/staging/prod configuration.
* *Monitoring & Logging*
** Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to monitor performance and collect logs from containers.
* *Scaling & Load Balancing*
** Kubernetes makes it easy to horizontally scale the app based on load using HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
