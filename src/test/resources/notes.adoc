== Overall quality score and Period over Period score change

**Overall Quality Score** is the average of all **category scores** for a given date, weighted using values from the `rating_categories` table.

**Period-over-Period Score Change** shows the **percentage difference** in overall score between two consecutive periods.

Scores are based on:

=== SQL

	rating_category_id AS categoryId,

	COUNT(*) AS ratingCount,
	SUM(rating) AS ratingSum,
	AVG(rating) AS averageRating
FROM ratings
WHERE DATE(created_at) = #{date}
GROUP BY rating_category_id
ORDER BY rating_category_id
